Hi, I’m **Franklyn Vasquez**

# About

I am a computer enthusiast. I am an Electronic Engineering Technology at Bronx Community College.
I began programming on AVR embedded microcontrollers. Programming on these embedded systems are a
great source of easy inspiration for programming, I at a mediocre pace started learning OOP. The
concept was very natural to me and then, I began programming for computers and I learned a lot by
writing [Nars-Libraries](GitHub.com/Nars-Libraries).

-------------------

*Familiar in*:
- C++
- C#
- Python

# Goals

## Employment

Right now I am unemployed and I'm looking to use my skills in programming as a career in software
development. I am in a rough financial situation in current times and on the edge of homelessness, 
I hope to find an employer that can see my skillset in programming.

## Growth & Improvement

I've began to learn algorithmic programming to expand my skillset and to be more favorable as a
candidate.

--------------------

I am already well familiar in debugging tools in Visual Studio 2019/22 for languages.
- C++
- C#
- Python

But this has been using simple break points and watches. These tools may be the most critical but
may not be efficient using only these tools.

--------------------

I'm also looking to improve my web-development skills as they are beginner level. Basic HTML/JS/CSS
