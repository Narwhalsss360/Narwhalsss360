#### What I learned here:

  **At this school, I took all required classes for graduation.**

  This school is also a trade school for Aviation. The experience was stellar in the
  F.A.A. Program. Students in the graduation year of *2021* were introduced to the
  job form style of work within the *first* month of the freshmen year. This is style
  was great experience for real-world work as students were given technical tasks described
  in job forms and student ***must*** follow F.A.A. regulations, as well as F.A.A. documentation
  on all jobs. Each job must be signed off by instructors to be able to complete the course.
