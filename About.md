## Major Projects

  I have only started development of large projects in October of 2021.

### [LibrariesRoot](https://github.com/Narwhalsss360/LibrariesRoot)

  This is the working repository for all of my libraries, it basically is a container
  for them to for example, allow to edit all of them from one codespace.

## [NALibs](https://github.com/Narwhalsss360/NALibs)

  This is the working repository for my Arduino libraries. This contain tools for testing, installing (Going to be changed) and
  sub-modules to each library. These libraries are under MIT License and are published on the
  [Arduino library registry](https://github.com/arduino/library-registry).
