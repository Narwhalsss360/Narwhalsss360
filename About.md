# Hello, I’m **Franklyn Vasquez**

# About 

  I am a computer enthusiast. I am an Electronic Engineering Technology at Bronx Community College.
  I began programming on AVR embedded microcontrollers. Programming on these embedded systems are a
  great source of easy inspiration for programming, I at a mediocre pace started learning OOP. The
  concept was very natural to me and then, I began programming for computers and I learned a lot by
  writing [Nars-Libraries](https://github.com/Narwhalsss360/Nars-Libraries), [NALibs](https://github.com/Narwhalsss360/NALibs)
  and other major pieces of code. See my latest resume [here](RESUME.md).

-------------------

  *Familiar in*:
  - C++
  - C#
  - Python

## Major Projects

  I have only started development of large projects in October of 2021.

### [Nars-Libraries](https://github.com/Narwhalsss360/Nars-Libraries)

  This major project was development of code-pieces that I found useful enough and used enough to create a
  my own libraries. Since this was the initial goal, this project was not designed well from the start. I 
  have begin to write new libraries that source from this but with much better design.

### [NALibs](https://github.com/Narwhalsss360/NALibs)

  This is the working repository for my Arduino libraries. This contain tools for testing, installing and
  sub-modules to each library. These libraries are under MIT License and are published on the
  [Arduino library registry](https://github.com/arduino/library-registry).
  The libraries in this repository are:
  - [NColor](https://github.com/Narwhalsss360/NColor)
  - [NDefs](https://github.com/Narwhalsss360/NDefs)
  - [NEvents](https://github.com/Narwhalsss360/NEvents)
  - [NFuncs](https://github.com/Narwhalsss360/NFuncs)
  - [NHC-SR04](https://github.com/Narwhalsss360/NHC-SR04)
  - NLinkedList This library is currently under development.
  - [NPush](https://github.com/Narwhalsss360/NPush)
  - [NRotary](https://github.com/Narwhalsss360/NRotary)
  - [NSerialCom](https://github.com/Narwhalsss360/NSerialCom)
  - [NTimer](https://github.com/Narwhalsss360/NTimer)
  - [NWire](https://github.com/Narwhalsss360/NWire)


# Goals

## Employment

  Right now I am unemployed and I'm looking to use my skills in programming as a career in software
  development. I am in a rough financial situation in current times and on the edge of homelessness, 
  I hope to find an employer that can see my skillset in programming.

## Growth & Improvement

  I've began to learn algorithmic programming to expand my skillset and to be more favorable as a
  candidate.

--------------------

  I am already well familiar in debugging tools in Visual Studio 2019/22 for languages.
  - C++
  - C#
  - Python

  But this has been using simple break points and watches. These tools may be the most critical but
  may not be efficient using only these tools.

--------------------

  I'm also looking to improve my web-development skills as they are beginner level. My current skill
  level is using basic HTML, JavaScript and CSS.
